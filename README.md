# Important Notice!

The version of Forge that we use **forge-1.16.5-36.2.33** must be downloaded from this repo as we use a very specific version due to compatability issues. **Please go through the following installation guide that I made. Make sure you select this version in all the following fields.**

# Installation Help Part 1: Installing
Managing the files and installing forge.

1. Go to the <a href="https://github.com/TheRealDezon/DragexSMP-Mods/releases" target="_blank">releases</a> section.

2. Find the **latest** release.

3. Download the source code for it:\

5. Run the forge installer by double clicking it. **Make sure you select `client` and that this is set to your minecraft folder:**\

# Installation Help Part 2: Settings
Configuring launch options to prevent crashing.

Head to task manager to check how much **RAM** you have. Go to the **Performance** section and click **Memory**:\

**For users with at least `8GB` of RAM.** Head back to the new installation section and hit **More Options**, look at the last section and make sure this number says **6**:\

**For users with `16GB+` of RAM.** Head back to the new installation section and hit **More Options** then make sure this number says **12**:\

**NOTICE:**
In my case I have 32GB of RAM, therefore using the above steps, I was able to allocate 16GB to minecraft. I heavily recomend doing this **if you have at least 20GB+ of RAM** to prevent crashes.

Once you complete this step, click **Create** to finish making the profile:\

4. Go to the folder you extracted earlier *the one with the forge installer, mods folder, etc.* and drag the **mods** folder and **config** folder to your **.minecraft** folder:\
![12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69148063/160251463-edb40e12-514a-4fb6-9ef2-b33aa6b52beb.png)
